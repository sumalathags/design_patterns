# Facade design pattern

The Facade design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, libraries or frameworks. It acts as a "facade" or "front-end" that shields clients from the complexity of the underlying subsystems. This pattern is useful when there is a need to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface to a complex system, or when you want to decouple the client code from the implementation details of the subsystems
