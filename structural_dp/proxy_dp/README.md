# Proxy design Pattern

The proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder object that controls access to another object, called the subject. The proxy object represents the subject and controls access to it by implementing the same interface as the subject, but with additional functionality such as access control, logging, or caching. This allows the proxy to perform actions before or after the real subject is accessed, or to prevent access altogether. Examples of proxy objects include virtual proxies, remote proxies, and protection proxies.
