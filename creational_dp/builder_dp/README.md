# Builder Design Pattern

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to create complex objects step by step through a builder object, hiding the construction process from the client. It provides a flexible approach to creating objects and helps to separate the construction of an object from its representation. The pattern consists of a builder interface for creating parts of a complex object and a concrete builder for implementing the builder interface and building the final object. The Director class uses the builder to create the final object.
