# Command Design Pattern

The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parametrization of clients with different requests, and the ability to queue or log requests. It promotes the "separation of concerns" by separating the objects that issue a request from the objects that actually process the request. The Command pattern is often used in the context of undo/redo functionality, as well as in the implementation of deferred execution of operations.
