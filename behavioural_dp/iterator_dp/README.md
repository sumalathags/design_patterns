# Iterator Design Pattern

The Iterator design pattern is a design pattern used to iterate through a collection of objects in a consistent way. It allows an object to provide a way to access its elements without exposing the underlying representation of the collection. This allows the collection to be changed while the iteration is ongoing, without affecting the iteration process. The Iterator pattern is used in many programming languages, including Java, C++, and Python.
